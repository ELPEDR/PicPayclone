PicPay Clone - Web App

This is a simple web application that mimics some features of the PicPay interface. Users can:

Add or remove virtual money from their account.

View their current balance and total accumulated money.

Reset all stored values to zero.

Toggle between light and dark themes.


The project was designed to give a basic structure for a balance-tracking app. It uses localStorage to save the balance and total amounts, so values are persistent across page reloads.

The interface was inspired by PicPay, including similar visual elements such as buttons, sections, and a responsive layout. Additionally, a button to request a virtual debit card is included (non-functional).

This project was created with assistance from ChatGPT.
